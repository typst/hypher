_hypher_ separates words into syllables.

```toml
[dependencies]
hypher = "0.1"
```

## Features
- All-inclusive: Hyphenation patterns are embedded into the binary as
  efficiently encoded finite automata at build time.
- Zero load time: Hyphenation automata operate directly over the embedded
  binary data with no up-front decoding.
- No allocations unless when hyphenating very long words (>= 39 bytes). You can
  disable the `alloc` feature, but then overly long words lead to a panic.
- Support for many languages.
- No unsafe code, no dependencies, no std.

## Example
```rust
use hypher::{hyphenate, Lang};

let syllables = hyphenate("extensive", Lang::English);
assert_eq!(syllables.join("-"), "ex-ten-sive");
```

## Languages
By default, this crate supports hyphenating more than 30 languages. Embedding
automata for all these languages will add ~1.1 MiB to your binary.
Alternatively, you can disable support for all languages and manually choose
which ones get added:

```toml
[dependencies]
hypher = { version = "0.1", default-features = false, features = ["english", "greek"] }
```

Each language added individually contributes:
